1. To send key strokes at intervals to perform skill combo
2. To send key strokes at to perform movement combo


safety issues:
* Use a random sleep-time and a random number of key strokes to simulate human-interactive-like key strokes
* Name your compiled program carefuly to avoid suspicion
* Avoid training for too long. It causes suspicion and attract GM patrol. (no reasonable human player can sit there for 8+ hours of training w/o break, 8 is just a number)

Usage:
